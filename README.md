## About the Course

Java Programming 1 introduces the foundational concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) using Java. Topics include:
- Java syntax and basic programming constructs (variables, loops, conditionals)
- Object-oriented programming concepts (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism)
- File handling and exception handling
- Basic data structures (arrays, lists, etc.)
- Practical problem-solving with Java

This repository documents my journey through this course.
